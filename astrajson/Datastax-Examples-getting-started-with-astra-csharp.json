Paging in Cassandra is different than what you are likely used to so it is beneficial to read <a href=\"https://docs.datastax.com/en/devapp/doc/devapp/driversResultPaging.html\">this</a> article describing how paging works with Cassandra.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How this Sample Works</h2>\n<p>This is am example .NET Core Web API backend for use with the Astra Getting Started UI which is found <a href=\"https://github.com/DataStax-Examples/getting-started-with-astra-ui\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>This application serves as the connection between the UI website and an underlying Astra database.</p>\n<p>It has Swagger installed so once it is running you can look at the Swagger UI here:</p>\n<p><code>http://localhost:5000/swagger/index.html#/</code></p>\n<h3>Connecting to Astra with a Secure Connect Bundle</h3>\n<p>To see how to connect to Astra using the Secure Connect Bundle you can look at the <code>ConnectToAstra()</code> method in <a href=\"Services/AstraService.cs\">Services/AstraService.cs</a>.  In this method you will find the code which:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Creates a <code>Cluster</code> instance using the builder.</p>\n<p><code>var session = Cluster.Builder()</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Specifies the local file path to the Secure Connect Bundle ZIP file that has been downloaded from your Astra Database.</p>\n<p><code>.WithCloudSecureConnectionBundle(secureConnectBundlePath)</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Set the username and password for your Astra Database</p>\n<p><code>.WithCredentials(username, password)</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Set the default Consistency Level to <code>LOCAL_QUORUM</code>.  <code>LOCAL_QUORUM</code> is the only supported consistency level for Astra queries.</p>\n<p><code>.WithQueryOptions(new QueryOptions().SetConsistencyLevel(ConsistencyLevel.LocalQuorum))</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Build the <code>Cluster</code> object then connect to your Astra database specifying the keyspace to use.</p>\n<p><code>.Build().Connect(keyspace);</code></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once you have completed all these steps you will now have a fully configured, connected, and ready to run CQL queries.</p>\n<h3>Managing Cassandra Session Within a .NET Web Application</h3>\n<p>Creation of <code>Session</code> objects within an application is an expensive process as they take awhile to initialize and become aware of the clusters topology.  Due to this it is a best practice to create a <code>Session</code> object once per application and reuse it throughout the entire lifetime of that application.  When building an ASP.NET Core application as shown this is easily supported through the use of singleton and .NET Core's built in Dependency Injection mechanisms.</p>\n<p>For our Web API endpoints we created a singleton instance of our <code>AstraService</code> object inside the <code>ConfigureServices()</code> method in <a href=\"Startup.cs\">Startup.cs</a> using the following code:</p>\n<p><code>services.AddSingleton(typeof(Interfaces.IDataStaxService), typeof(Services.AstraService));</code></p>\n<p>This code specifies that we are adding a singleton instance of <code>AstraService</code> for any dependency requiring ",
