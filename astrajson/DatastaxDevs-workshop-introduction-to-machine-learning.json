Objectives</h2>\n<p>1\ufe0f\u20e3 <strong>Learn about the NoSQL database Apache Cassandra\u2122</strong></p>\n<p>2\ufe0f\u20e3 <strong>Meet Apache Spark\u2122 and its superpowers</strong></p>\n<p>3\ufe0f\u20e3 <strong>Learn about the main ideas and practice of Machine Learning (ML)</strong></p>\n<p>4\ufe0f\u20e3 <strong>Get a practical understanding of some of the main ML algorithms</strong></p>\n<p>\ud83d\ude80 <strong>Have fun with an interactive session (Python interactive notebooks + Cassandra + Spark)</strong></p>\n<h2>2. Frequently asked questions</h2>\n<details>\n<summary><strong>1\ufe0f\u20e3 Can I run this workshop on my computer?</strong></summary>\n<p>There is nothing preventing you from running the workshop on your own machine. If you do so, you will need: <code>git</code>, <code>docker</code>, <code>docker-compose</code>.</p>\n<p>In this readme, we try to provide instructions for local development as well - but keep in mind that the main focus is development on Gitpod, hence <strong>we can't guarantee live support</strong> about local development in order to keep on track with the schedule. However, we will do our best to give you the info you need to succeed.</p>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary><strong>2\ufe0f\u20e3 Are there other prerequisites?</strong></summary>\n<p>You will need enough <em>real estate</em> on screen, we will ask you to open a few windows and it would not fit on mobiles (tablets should be OK).</p>\n<p>You will need an Astra account: don't worry, we'll work through that in the following.</p>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary><strong>3\ufe0f\u20e3 Do I need to pay for anything for this workshop?</strong></summary>\n<p><strong>No.</strong> All tools and services we provide here are FREE. FREE not only during the session but also afterwards.</p>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary><strong>4\ufe0f\u20e3 Will I get a certificate if I attend this workshop?</strong></summary>\n<p>Attending the session is not enough. You need to complete the <a href=\"#7-homework\">homework detailed below</a><br />\nand you will get a nice badge that you can share on linkedin or anywhere else<br />\n<em>(the badge conforms to the &quot;open badge&quot; specifications)</em>.</p>\n</details>\n<h2>3.
