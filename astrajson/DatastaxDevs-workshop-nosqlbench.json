Please choose what best suits you!\n\n\n\n### FAQ\n\n- What are the prerequisites?\n\n> This workshop is aimed at data architects, solution architects, developers, or anybody who\n> wants to get serious about measuring the performance of their data-intensive system.\n> You should know what a (distributed) database is, and have a general understanding of the\n> challenges of communicating over a network.\n\n- Do I need to install a database or anything on my machine?\n\n> No, no need to install anything. You will do everything in the browser.\n> (That being said, the knowledge you gain today will probably be best put to\n> use once you install NoSQLBench on some client machine to run tests.)\n\n> You can also choose to work on your machine instead of using Gitpod: there's\n> no problem with that, just a few setup and operational changes to keep\n> in mind. We will not provide live support in this case, though,\n> assuming you know what you are doing.\n\n- Is there anything to pay?\n\n> **No.** All materials, services and software used in this workshop is _free_.\n\n- Do you cover NoSQLBench 4 or 5?\n\n> Ah, I see you are a connoisseur. We focus on the newly-release **NoSQLBench 5**,\n> but we provide tips and remarks aimed at those still using nb4.\n\n### Homework\n\n<img src=\"images/nosqlbench_badge_artwork.png?raw=true\" width=\"200\" align=\"right\" />\n\nTo complete the workshop and get a verified \"NoSQLBench\" badge,\nfollow these instructions:\n\n1. Do the hands-on practice, either during the workshop or by following the instructions in this README;\n2. (optional) Complete the \"Lab\" assignment as detailed [here](homework/homework.md);\n3. Fill the submission form [here](https://dtsx.io/homework-nosqlbench). Answer the theory questions and (optionally) provide a _screenshot_ of the completed \"Lab\" part;\n4. give us a few days to process your submission: you should receive your well-earned badge in your email inbox!\n\n\n\n## Create your Astra DB instance\n\nFirst you must create a database: an instance of Astra DB, which\nyou will then benchmark with NoSQLBench.\n\n> Don't worry, you will create\n> it within the \"Free Tier\", which offers quite a generous free\n> allowance in terms of monthly I/O (about 40M operations per month)\n> and storage (80 GB).\n\n<a href=\"https://astra.datastax.com\"><img src=\"images/create_astra_db.png?raw=true\" /></a>\n\nYou need to:\n\n- create an Astra DB instance [as explained here](https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/pages/astra/create-instance/#c-procedure), with **database name** = `workshops` and **keyspace name** = `nbkeyspace`;\n- _(this will happen automatically with the previous one)_ generate and retrieve a DB Token [as explained here](https://awesome-astra.github.io/doc"
