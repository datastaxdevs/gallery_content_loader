    "readme": "<h1>Workshop - Application Development with Cassandra</h1>\n<p>Learn about drivers, connectivity and requests by running a simple API with<br />\nApache Cassandra/Astra DB as its data backend. The steps are available in <em>several languages</em>.</p>\n<p>Click here for the workshop <a href=\"slides/slides.pdf\">slide deck</a>.</p>\n<h3>Pre-requisites</h3>\n<p>This workshop, the third in a series, builds on the same example used in the two previous episodes (an IoT application to access temperature measurements collected from a network of sensors).</p>\n<p>Besides some knowledge of the <a href=\"https://www.datastax.com/learn/data-modeling-by-example/sensor-data-model\">example domain</a> used in this workshop, it is desirable to have familiarity with the concepts explored in the two previous installments of the series:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-cassandra-fundamentals\">Cassandra Fundamentals</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-cassandra-data-modeling\">Data Modeling with Cassandra</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Database pre-requisites</h4>\n<p>It is assumed in the following that you already have created your <a href=\"https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-cassandra-fundamentals#4-create-your-astra-db-instance\">Astra DB instance</a> as instructed in the first episode, and that you have a valid &quot;DB Administrator&quot; Token.<br />\n<strong>Note</strong>: the Token that is created with the database does not have all permissions we need, so you <em>need</em> to manually <a href=\"https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/pages/astra/create-token/\">create a Token</a> with the higher &quot;DB Administrator&quot; permission and use it in what comes next.</p>\n<p><em>In case you haven't your Astra DB yet, go ahead and create it now for free by clicking here:</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://astra.dev/yt-01-25-23\"><img src=\"images/create_astra_db_button.png?raw=true\" /></a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Tip</em>: call the database <code>workshops</code> and the keyspace <code>sensor_data</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>In case you already have a database <code>workshops</code> but no <code>sensor_data</code> keyspace, simply add it using the &quot;Add Keyspace&quot; button on the bottom right hand corner of your DB dashboard: please do so, avoiding the creation of another database with the same name. (Also, on the free tier you have to &quot;Resume&quot; the database if it is &quot;Hibernated&quot; for prolonged inactivity.)</em></p>\n<h2>1. Setup</h2>\n<h3>Astra DB &quot;Administrator&quot; token</h3>\n<p>If you don't have a &quot;DB Administrator&quot; token yet, log in to your Astra DB<br />\nand create a token with this role.<br />\nTo create the token, click on the &quot;...&quot; menu next to your database in the main<br />\nAstra dashboard and choose &quot;Generate token&quot;. Then make sure you select the &quot;DB Administrator&quot; role.<br />\n<em>Download or note down all components of the token before navigating away:<br />\nthese will not be shown again.</em><br />\n<a href=\"https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/pages/astra/create-token/\">See here</a><br />\nfor more on token creation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>\u26a0\ufe0f Important</strong></p>\n<pre><code>The instructor will show the token creation on screen,\nbut will then destroy it immediately for security reasons.\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Mind that, as mentioned already, <em>the default Token auto-created for you when<br />\ncreating the database is not powerful enough for us today.</em></p>\n<h3>Gitpod</h3>\n<p>First, open this repo in Gitpod by right-clicking the following button (&quot;open in new tab&quot;):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-cassandra-application-development\"><img src=\"images/open_in_gitpod.svg?raw=true\" /></a></p>\n<p>In a couple of minutes you will have your Gitpod IDE up and running, with this repo cloned, ready and waiting for you (you may have to authorize the Gitpod single-sign-on to continue).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You may see a dialog about &quot;opening this workspace in VS Code Desktop&quot;: you can safely dismiss it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Note</em>: The next steps are to be executed <em>within the Gitpod IDE.</em></p>\n<h3>Configure the Astra CLI</h3>\n<p>Astra CLI is preinstalled: configure it by providing your<br />\n<code>AstraCS:...</code> database token when prompted:</p>\n<pre lang=\"bash\"><code>astra setup\n</code></pre>\n<p>(<em>Optional)</em> Now you can use the CLI to get some info on your database(s):</p>\n<pre lang=\"bash\"><code>astra db list\nastra db get workshops\n</code></pre>\n<details><summary>Click here if you have <strong>multiple databases</strong> called \"workshops\"</summary>\n<p>DB names are not required to be unique: what <em>is</em> unique is the <a href=\"https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/pages/astra/faq/#where-should-i-find-a-database-identifier\">&quot;Database ID&quot;</a>.</p>\n<p>In case you find yourself having more than one &quot;workshops",
