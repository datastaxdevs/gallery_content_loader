If so, then this content is for **you**!\n\nWorldwide digital sales in 2020 eclipsed four trillion dollars (USD).  Businesses that want to compete, need a high performing e-commerce website.  Here, we will demonstrate how to build a high performing persistence layer with DataStax **`ASTRA DB`**.\n\nWhy does an e-commerce site need to be fast?  Because most consumers will leave a web page or a mobile app if it takes longer than a few seconds to load.  In the content below, we will cover how to build high-performing data models and services, helping you to build a e-commerce site with high throughput and low latency.\n\n## 2. Create Astra DB and Streaming Instances\n\nYou can skip to step 2c if you have already created a keyspace `ecommerce` in database `demos`. Otherwise (if you did not attend the previous installment of the e-commerce worksop):\n\n**`ASTRA DB`** is the simplest way to run Cassandra with zero operations - just push the button and get your cluster. No credit card required, $25.00 USD credit every month, roughly 20M read/write operations, 80GB storage monthly - sufficient to run small production workloads.\n\n#### \u2705 2a. Register\n\nIf you do not have an account yet, register and sign in to Astra DB: This is FREE and NO CREDIT CARD is required. [https://astra.datastax.com](https://astra.dev/yt-11-30): You can use your `Github`, `Google` accounts or register with an `email`.\n\n_Make sure to chose a password with minimum 8 characters, containing upper and lowercase letters, at least one number and special character_\n\n#### \u2705 2b. Create a DB on the \"FREE\" plan\n\nFollow this [guide](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/docs/creating-your-astra-database.html), to set up a pay as you go database with a free $25 monthly credit. You will find below recommended values to enter:\n\n- **For the database name** - `demos`\n\n- **For the keyspace name** - `ecommerce`\n\n_You can technically use whatever name(s) you want and update the code to reflect the keyspace. This is really to get you on a happy path for the first run._\n\n- **For provider and region**: For Astra DB, select GCP as a provider and then the related region is where your database will reside physically (choose one close to you or your users).\n\n- **Create the database**. Review all the fields to make sure they are as shown, and click the `Create Database` button.\n\n**\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f Walkthrough**\n\n*The Walkthrough mentions a different keyspace, make sure to use `ecommerce`*\n\n![image](data/img/astra-create-db.gif?raw=true)\nYou will see your new database `pending` in the Dashboard.\n\n![my-pic](data/img/db-pending.png?raw=true)\n\n#### \u2705 2c. Ensure the database turns to active state\n\nTo connect to the database programmatically, you need to make sure the status will change to `Active`. This happens when the database is ready, and will only take 2-3 minutes. You will also receive an email when it is ready.\n\n**\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f Expected Output**\n\n![my-pic](data/img/db-"
