In this two-hour workshop, we show the methodology to build an effective data model with the distributed <code>NoSQL database Apache Cassandra\u2122</code>.</p>\n<p>Using <strong>Astra DB</strong>, the cloud based <em>Cassandra-as-a-Service</em> platform delivered by DataStax, we will cover the process for every developer who wants to build an application: list the use cases and build an effective data model.</p>\n<p><img src=\"images/splash.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>It doesn't matter if you join our workshop live or you prefer to do at your own pace, we have you covered.

Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n<p/>\n<details>\n<summary><b> 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Can I run this workshop on my computer?</b></summary>\n<hr>\n<p>There is nothing preventing you from running the workshop on your own machine. If you do so, you will need the following:\n<ol>\n<li><b>git</b> installed on your local system\n</ol>\n</p>\nIn this readme, we try to provide instructions for local development as well - but keep in mind that the main focus is development on Gitpod, hence <strong>we can't guarantee live support</strong> about local development in order to keep on track with the schedule. However, we will do our best to give you the info you need to succeed.\n</details>\n<p/>\n<details>\n<summary><b> 2\ufe0f\u20e3 What other prerequisites are required?</b></summary>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>You will need enough \"real estate\" on screen, we will ask you to open a few windows and it would not fit on mobiles (tablets should be OK)\n<li>You will need an Astra account: don't worry, we'll work through that in the following\n<li>As \"Intermediate level\" we expect you to know what java and Spring are.\n</ul>\n</p>\n</details>\n<p/>\n<details>\n<summary><b> 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Do I need to pay for anything for this workshop?</b></summary>\n<hr>\n<b>No.</b> All tools and services we provide here are FREE. FREE not only during the session but also after.\n</details>\n<p/>\n<details>\n<summary><b> 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Will I get a certificate if I attend this workshop?</b></summary>\n<hr>\nAttending the session is not enough. You need to complete the homework detailed below and you will get a nice badge that you can share on LinkedIn or anywhere else.\n</details>\n<p/>\n<h2>3.

Create Your Astra DB Instance</h2>\n<p><em><strong><code>ASTRA DB</code></strong> is the simplest way to run Cassandra with zero operations at all - just push the button and get your cluster. No credit card required, 40M read/write operations and about 80GB storage monthly for free - sufficient to run small production workloads. If you end your credits the databases will pause, no charge</em></p>\n<p>Leveraging <a href=\"https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/pages/astra/create-instance/#c-procedure\">Database creation guide</a> create a database. <em>Right-Click the button</em> with <em>Open in a new TAB.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://astra.dev/yt-7-27\"><img src=\"images/create_astra_db_button.png?",
